Sandhi in Sanskrit involves complex phonetic transformations when words or morphemes 
combine, making it challenging to split words correctly. This poses difficulties for learners, 
researchers, and NLP applications.   
 
Our AI model addresses this by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), machine 
learning, and linguistic rules to accurately identify and split Sandhi in Sanskrit. The RAG model 
enhances accuracy by retrieving relevant linguistic data before generating precise splits, 
ensuring both context-aware and rule-based segmentation.
